* *Docker*: Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed and running.

### 1. Clone the Repositories

Clone both the frontend and backend repositories to your local machine.

bash
git clone <your-backend-repo-url>
git clone <your-frontend-repo-url>


### 2. Backend Setup

1.  *Navigate to the backend project directory:*
    bash
    cd <your-backend-folder-name>
    

2.  *Install dependencies:*
    bash
    npm install
    

3.  *Create the Environment File:* Create a file named .env in the root of your backend project and add the following variables.

## â–¶ Running the Application

You will need to have *3 separate terminals* open to run the entire application.

### Terminal 1: Start the Database

Start the Elasticsearch container using Docker.
bash
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.9.2

*Important*: Wait about 60 seconds for it to fully initialize. You can verify it's ready by visiting http://localhost:9200 in your browser. You should see a JSON response.

### Terminal 2: Start the Backend Server

Once the database is ready, navigate to your backend folder and run:
bash
npm run dev

The server will start on http://localhost:5555.

### Terminal 3: Start the Frontend Application

Finally, navigate to your frontend folder and run:
bash
npm run dev

The React application will open in your browser, usually at http://localhost:5173.
